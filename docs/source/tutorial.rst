create procedure
----------------

Letâ€™s create some procedure:

.. include:: tutorial/create_auction.http
    :code:


Success! Now we can see that new object has been created. Response code is `201`
and `Location` response header reports the location of the created object.  The
body of response reveals the information about the created auction: its internal
`id` (that matches the `Location` segment), its official `auctionID` and
`dateModified` datestamp stating the moment in time when auction has been last
modified. Pay attention to the `procurementMethodType`. Note that auction is
created with `draft` status.

You can GET the auction as long as it's been created

.. include:: tutorial/get_draft_auction.http

For the procedure to be activated you should apply
a two-phase commit (manually switch procedure to `active.rectification` status)
